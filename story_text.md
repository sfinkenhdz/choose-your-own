OUTCOME1 - TEXT

As do many great adventures, this one begins with the near destruction of Earth. The planet has been devastated by a massive meteor shower. As well as causing immediate destruction, the meteors' impact has set off a chain reaction of fire, floods, tsunamis and a slew of other disasters.

To make matters even worse, the Daleks see this moment of vulnerability as the perfect opportunity to wipe out what remains of the human race.

Dr. Who has called us in to help save the world.

[Note: there will be a few references to Dr. Who throughout this adventure. If you are unfamiliar, fear not! Here's what you need to know:
  1. Dr. Who is Time Lord. He travels through time and space saving our world and others in a ship called the TARDIS that looks like a 1960's police telephone box.
  2. His archnemeses are the Daleks. They are deadly and pure evil.
  3. You should really do yourself a favor and start watching Dr. Who. It's not on Netflix anymore, so you'll have to invest in DVDs. You won't regret it.]

Here are the details that Dr. Who shares with us-

The few remaining pockets of survivors near us have clustered into a handful of groups, with different skills and culture. None of the groups will likely survive long without cooperation from the others.

Here's what we know about the groups:
GROUP 1: has decided to tackle to the Dalek threat head on. They are smart and analytical and have created a system for tracking Daleks if they are nearby, and are working to exploit the few Dalek weaknesses to create a system of defense. They are having success, but it also sounds like there is a lot of competition and in-fighting within the group.

GROUP 2: is thinking about protection from the Daleks, extreme weather, and other threats. They are very creative, and have created a wide variety of shelter out of anything they can find. It works, but quality varies greatly. So far they have found enough food in the ruins to survive, but this will soon run out and they realize this.

GROUP 3: appears to be doing, well, not much of anything. They are camped out by a river and don't seem to have much of a plan. The land near the river grows various berry bushes and other edible plants. The group seems to be doing all right for now, and don't seem too interested in a longer-term plan or working harder.

GROUP 4: has food figured out. They scavenged food from the wreckage, but rather than eating all of it directly, they have been using it primarily as bait to lure various types of small game. (Who knew squirrels had such a love of Skittles and SweetTarts?) They have also explored a much larger area than the other groups and have found various clusters of other edibles that can be foraged. They're cautious, but welcoming.

<!-- They of course have a large fire that is always tended. Just because humans are on the verge of extinction doesn't mean we can't have a hot meal. This has helped keep predators at bay, but the bait strategy is attracting more and more unwanted guests.  -->

<!--   Oh, one last thing. We have a sidekick--Spiffy, the penguin. We'll be able to have more dynamic interactions with three people. -->

Now, for our first decision: Shall we make a plan, or start by visiting the group closest to us?
END OF OUTCOME1 TEXT

CHOICE1-PLAN:
  TEXT:
  Great choice! It's important to have a plan, but the clock is ticking so let's be sure we don't spend all of our time planning, leaving no time to put the plan into action.

  Let's decide how to prioritize, then head out.

OUTCOME 2: CHOOSE Easy/Hard
  How should we prioritize which groups to visit first? Easiest to persuade, or most difficult - get a sense of what they need to be persuaded (most knowledge)
  END

CHOICE3-EASIEST:
  TEXT
  I would have started with the most difficult group, because when solving a problem, I like to get an idea of the scope, especially getting a feel for the parts that could be the most challenging or time-consuming. (biggest variable)

  But, there are good reasons to get a good ally on our side early on (deliverable), and since we're working together, both of our ideas are important.
  END

OUTCOME4:
  GO TO SHELTER GROUP.

  GO TO FOOD. -->

CHOICE4-MOST DIFFICULT:
  TEXT
  This is what I would have chosen, too. When solving a problem, I like to get an idea of the scope, especially getting a feel for the parts that could be the most challenging or time-consuming. (biggest variable)

  GO TO DEFENSE/OFFENSE.
  END


CHOICE2-CLOSEST GROUP:
  TEXT
  You know, I probably would have spent some time planning, but I appreciate your desire to get started. I think it is important to plan and make informed decisions, but sometimes it is too easy to spend too much time making the plan, and not enough executing it. We'll need to talk to everyone, so let's go!
  END

  OUTCOME3-GO TO DEFENSE/OFFENSE.

  ---------------

  OUTCOME3-DEFENSE/OFFENSE:
  TEXT:
  We visit the group that has a good system for protecting themselves from (disaster). They have decent shelter, and a moderate food supply. They recognize that both of these needs could be better met since they have been focusing on stopping the spread of (disaster).

  This is a tough group becasue xxx. They are pretty ego-tystical and think they are better than the other groups.

  Should we tell them how great they are, or tell them they are wrong?
  END

  CHOICE5-THEY ARE GREAT:
  TEXT
  Like so many of us, this group responds really well to positive reinforcement. And, they really have done exceptional work crafting a means of stopping the spread of (disaster). Making the temperamental members of this group feel good about themselves let them feel more comfortable admitting they need xx from the others.

  Success!
  END

  CHOICE6-THEY ARE WRONG:
  TEXT
  Whoa. Well, that made them mad. Now, they are demanding that we leave.

  OUTCOME 5: CHOOSE LEAVE/APOLOGIZE
  Should we go, or apologize?
  END

  GO:  Fortunately, the group members took our retreat as a show of respect and have agreed to cooperate and share what their knowledge with the others.

    OUTCOME6:
    FOOD: Now that we have succeeded with this group, on to the next! Based on (decision), next we go to the group that has mastered the food system.

  APOLOGIZE: Fortunately, the group members accept our apology. It takes a big person to admit that they are wrong! They now respect us and have agreed to cooperate.

    FOOD: Now that we have succeeded with this group, on to the next! Based on (decision), next we go to the group that has mastered the food system.

    As we near this group, we pass a child gathering firewood to bring back. Should we take the time to stop to help?


    CHOICE11: YES
    Well, you know what I always say. "Be helpful."
    "Oh really," you respond. "That's what you always say?"
    "Yep. Always. It's something of a credo of mine, if you know what I mean."

    We all gather armloads of firewood, from small twigs for kindling to larger logs.

    When we arrive, the group leaders are impressed by our helpfulness.

    This group is very organized, detail-oriented and good at developing systems, so they also appreciate that we thought to consider the variety of wood that would be needed.

    OUTCOME10: Gain trust
    This small choice helps us gain trust immediately.

    CHOICE12: NO
    "Hmmmm, I think it's usually a good idea to be helpful and pitch in whenever possible, but let's see what happens," I say.

    "I think 'Be helpful' is a pretty good credo, if you know what I mean."

    OUTCOME11: Skepticism
    Group leaders are a little skeptical that we have come to them asking for cooperation after having just decided to not help with a simple task.

    We are going to have to gain their trust.

    CHOICE13: Trust Falls
    Why not?

    CHOICE14: Manual Labor

    OUTCOME12: Gain trust of food group
    For whatever reason, this act has been enough to gain the trust of the group. They now feel that you have proven your worth and sincerity. They agree to cooperate.

    Now, we will travel to our final group.

    CHOICE15: Go to lazy group
    (text below)


  OUTCOME4, SHELTER: We have arrived at a patchwork of makeshift homes. (description of some -- vague reference to one that looks like a TARDIS) All provide basic protection from the elements and at least some barrier to fend off attacking creatues. However, a lack of long-term planning is evident. The dwellings built first are far superior and some have redundant features using materials that would have been better saved for homes built later on.

  (impressed by their creativity, I like to build stuff)

  We know that this is inclined to cooperate with others, and are further motivated by the knowledge that their food supply will run out soon. So, we have a pretty easy decision to make.  Should we invite them to cooperate in the great building of humanity, or should we throw rocks at them?

  CHOICE 10: INVITE TO COOPERATE: Great choice!

  CHOICE 9:
  THROW ROCKS: no text

  OUTCOME 9: STUPID CHOICE
  Seriously?
  CHOICE 10: INVITE TO COOPERATE: Great choice!

    OUTCOME 8: SUCCESS WITH SHELTER
    Not surprisingly, this hungry, collaborative group is more than happy to join our efforts to rebuild humanity.

CHOICE15: Go to lazy group
Our walk to our final destination is a long one. They are all the way down by the river.

CHOICE16:
Name: Who needs them?
Text: "Well, we need them. Remember our task is to get everyone to work together?"

OUTCOME13:
Name: Yes, we do.
Text: Let's go. -- to choice15

OUTCOME14: Leave
As we are about to leave, you ask, "Isn't this the group described as being lazy? Strange that the lazy people would travel this far away just to sit around and do nothing."

"That is strange," I reply.

"Well, they are. Wasn't that clearly explained to you?" a nearby group member asks. "You said Dr. Who sent you, didn't you? He's very clever."

We don't want to look stupid in front of our new allies, especially now that we are so close to succeeding. However, you've made an excellent point and we don't actually know that much.

Should we admit we don't know, or pretend we have all the details to save face in front of our new friends?

CHOICE17:
Name: We know everything!
Text:
"Buuuut, we don't know everything," I whisper to you.

"They don't need to know that," you whisper back.

And, off we go.

OUTCOME16:
Name: Admit we don't know.
Text:
"Why exactly is that the lazy group?" I ask.

"I dunno," the person replies.

We decide to call Dr. Who to get a little more info.

"Ah yes, the lazy group down by the river. I don't know that they are actually all that lazy. Actually, I don't know that they are always down by the river, either. There is a large system of caves about a half mile east of the river where they spend a lot of time, too. Did I mention that? No? Ah, well, lots to do. Can't remember everything. Check the caves! Got to run. Queen Elizabeth awaits."

And Dr. Who jumps into the TARDIS and leaves.

"Well, that was a helpful tip about the caves," I say. "I'm glad we asked. I haven't always liked asking for help, but it sure comes in handy sometimes."

Should we go to the caves or the river?

CHOICE26:
Name:Caves

CHOICE27:
Name:River
Text: Unfortuntely, when we arrive at the stretch of river where the loafers are supposed to be loafing, no one is there. No sign of any humans.

"Well, I guess it's on to the caves."

OUTCOME20:
Name:To the caves!
Text: none

OUTCOME15:
Unfortuntely, when we arrive at the stretch of river where the loafers are supposed to be loafing, no one is there. No sign of any humans.

We look around and eventually find a fishing pole and bucket. There are people around after all. We sit down to discuss our options, and soon after a mother and child appear, looking for the fishing gear.

Should we ask for help, or keep pretending we know what we are doing?

CHOICE19: Ask for help.
"Excuse me!" I call out. "We heard there was a group of people down here by the river."

"Oh yes," she replies. "We spend part of the day here, but we are back at the caves now. Come with me."


OUTCOME17:
Name: Arrive at final group.
Text: When we arrive at the caves, members of the group are happy to show us around. It quickly becomes evident that the so-called lazy group is anything but.

As they show us around and explain what they've been up to, it becomes clear that this group is actually an excellent team. They have been working hard, but took the time to assess what they needed, resources available, and each person's strengths and weaknesses. Because they have been working so well together, they haven't appeared quite as stressed out as the other groups, and have even been having some fun.

One key to success was realizing the benefit of the caves. Low entrances and narrow passageways make many parts of the caves inaccessible to the Daleks, and provide shelter. Proximity to the river provides a variety of potential food sources.

By consistently exploring, experimenting and communicating they have been able to figure out how to best use the benefits of the cave and river, how to maximize their food sources without depleting them and have developed a system of standing guard, preparing food, exploring. And, they realize need to have some fun.

Next step, reach out to other groups, so happy to join our collective efforts.

"I guess that's why you shouldn't make assumptions," you comment.

"Yes. That's pretty important. I'm glad we didn't write them off. This group has really figured it out," I say. "Values, type of people I'd like to work with, etc. And, it's really paying off!"

CHOICE26:
Name: Party
Thanks to our hard work and good decisions, everyone cooperates, thrives and humanity is saved!

Let's party!

CHOICE27:
Name: Parade
Thanks to our hard work and good decisions, everyone cooperates, thrives and humanity is saved!

Let's have a parade!

CHOICE28:
Name: Both
Thanks to our hard work and good decisions, everyone cooperates, thrives and humanity is saved!

This deserves a big celebration--let's go nuts and have a party AND a parade!


CHOICE21:
Name: Keep pretending.

OUTCOME18:
Name: Still pretending
Text:
"Hello there," the woman greets us. "You look lost.  Need any help?"

CHOICE22:
Name: Yes.
Text:
"Yes, thanks! We're looking for a group of people living down here by the river."
-->OUTCOME17


CHOICE23:
Name: Nope.
Text: "Nope. We're fine. Everything under control here. We were actually just, uh, leaving."


OUTCOME19:
We confidently stride back from where we came. The woman looks at us strangely and walks away.

It's starting to get dark now, and we still don't know where we are going. Maybe we should look for a place to spend the night. Maybe we should go back where we came from.

Just then, a man comes walking towards us, hurrying towards the river.

Should we ask for directions, or keep faking it?

Okay, this is getting silly.

CHOICE24 and CHOICE25:
Name: Ask for directions.
"Hi! We are looking for a group of people down here by the river. Do you know where they are?"

"I sure do! Come with me," he replies.

I haven't always liked asking for help.
Isn't asking for help great?

-->OUTCOME17


CHOICE18:
Name: No, we don't.


OUTCOME21:
Name: Conclusion

Now, amidst all of the hugging, hand-shaking, back-slapping, joyful crying and general congratulatory revelrie, you may also be wondering, how close did I come to making the wrong choice and ending humanity's last hope? What did I miss by making the choices that I made.

Let me assure you that although you and I make an amazing team, our success was guaranteed. To save both your time and mine, and to make sure getting to know each other wasn't cut short by quick wins or losses, you've experienced most major plot points one way or another regardless of your decisions.

Like coding, there is more than one way to get to the right answer. Some may take longer, some may be more clear or elegant, but xxx works.
