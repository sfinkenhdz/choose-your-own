Great--I think we'll learn a lot more about each other this way.

-As do many great adventures, this one begins with the near destruction of earth.
Choose your favorite disaster:
  -zombies
  -dinosaurs
  -alien-carrying meteor
  -oubreak
(Sets background and language.)

-Two weeks ago, (disaster) has wiped out nearly all humans on earth. The few remaining pockets of survivors near us have clustered into a handful of groups, with different skills and culture. None of the groups will likely survive long without cooperation from one or more other groups.

Our task is to unite and save humanity. Why us? xxx

[time limit]

Here's what we know about the clusters of surviving humans -
  -The first group has decided to tackle to (disaster) head on. They are analytical and have created a system for tracking the spread of (disaster), its impact, weaknesses and they are working on developing a defense. They are having success, but it also sounds like there is a lot of competition and in-fighting within the group.
  -The second group is thinking about both the impact of the disaster, but also other threats. They have been focusing on shelter to protect themselves from (disaster), weather, possible predators returning to the crumbling city, and hey, why not have a little comfort? They have created a wide variety of shelter out of anything they can find. It works, but quality varies greatly. They're cautious, but welcomeing.
  (Food from buildings-will run out soon)
  -The third group appears to be doing, not much of anything. They are camped out by a river and don't seem to have much of a plan. The land near the river grows various berry bushes and other edible plants. The group seems to be doing all right for now, and don't seem too interested in a longer-term plan or working harder.

  -The fourth group has food figured out. (They have divided into groups.) They scavenged food from the wreckage, but rather than eating all of it directly, they have been using it primarily as bait to lure various types of small game. (Who knew that rabbits prefer x, while t prefer y.) They have also explored a much larger area than the other groups and have found various clusters of other edibles that can be foraged. They of course have a large fire that is always tended. Just because humans are on the verge of extinction doesn't mean we have to eat raw meat. This has helped keep predators at bay, but the bait strategy is attracting more and more unwanted guests.

  Oh, one last thing. We have a sidekick--Spiffy, the penguin. We'll be able to have more dynamic interactions with three people.

Now, for our first decision: Shall we make a plan, or start by visiting the group closest to us?
