Great--I think we'll learn a lot more about each other this way.

-As do many great adventures, this one begins with the near destruction of earth.
Choose your favorite disaster:
  -zombies

  -oubreak
(Sets background and language.)

-Two weeks ago, (disaster) has wiped out nearly all humans on earth. The few remaining pockets of survivors near us have clustered into a handful of groups, with different skills and culture. None of the groups will likely survive long without cooperation from one or more other groups.

Our task is to unite and save humanity. Why us? xxx

[time limit]

Here's what we know about the clusters of surviving humans -
  -The first group has decided to tackle to (disaster) head on. They are analytical and have created a system for tracking the spread of (disaster), its impact, weaknesses and they are working on developing a defense. They are having success, but it also sounds like there is a lot of competition and in-fighting within the group.
  -The second group is thinking about both the impact of the disaster, but also other threats. They have been focusing on shelter to protect themselves from (disaster), weather, possible predators returning to the crumbling city, and hey, why not have a little comfort? They are very creative, and have created a wide variety of shelter out of anything they can find. It works, but quality varies greatly.
  (Food from buildings-will run out soon and they realize this.)
  -The third group appears to be doing, not much of anything. They are camped out by a river and don't seem to have much of a plan. The land near the river grows various berry bushes and other edible plants. The group seems to be doing all right for now, and don't seem too interested in a longer-term plan or working harder.
  (cave)
  -The fourth group has food figured out. (They have divided into groups.) They scavenged food from the wreckage, but rather than eating all of it directly, they have been using it primarily as bait to lure various types of small game. (Who knew that rabbits prefer x, while t prefer y.) They have also explored a much larger area than the other groups and have found various clusters of other edibles that can be foraged. They of course have a large fire that is always tended. Just because humans are on the verge of extinction doesn't mean we have to eat raw meat. This has helped keep predators at bay, but the bait strategy is attracting more and more unwanted guests. They're cautious, but welcomeing.

  Oh, one last thing. We have a sidekick--Spiffy, the penguin. We'll be able to have more dynamic interactions with three people.

Now, for our first decision: Shall we make a plan, or start by visiting the group closest to us?

1PLAN:
  Great choice! It's important to have a plan, but the clock is ticking so let's be sure we don't spend all of our time planning, leaving no time to put the plan into action.

  Let's decide how to prioritize, then head out.

  How should we prioritize which groups to visit first? Easiest to persuade, or most difficult - get a sense of what they need to be persuaded (most knowledge)

EASIEST:
  I would have started with the most difficult group, because when solving a problem, I like to get an idea of the scope, especially getting a feel for the parts that could be the most challenging or time-consuming. (biggest variable)

  But, there are good reasons to get a good ally on our side early on (deliverable), and since we're working together, both of our ideas are important.

  GO TO SHELTER.

<!-- MV RESOURCE:

  GO TO FOOD. -->

MOST DIFFICULT:
  This is what I would have chosen, too. When solving a problem, I like to get an idea of the scope, especially getting a feel for the parts that could be the most challenging or time-consuming. (biggest variable)

  GO TO DEFENSE/OFFENSE.


1CLOSEST GROUP:
  You know, I probably would have spent some time planning, but I appreciate your desire to get started. I think it is important to plan and make informed decisions, but sometimes it is too easy to spend too much time making the plan, and not enough executing it. We'll need to talk to everyone, so let's go!

  GO TO DEFENSE/OFFENSE.

  ---------------

  2DEFENSE/OFFENSE:
  We visit the group that has a good system for protecting themselves from (disaster). They have decent shelter, and a moderate food supply. They recognize that both of these needs could be better met since they have been focusing on stopping the spread of (disaster).

  This is a tough group becasue xxx. They are pretty ego-tystical and think they are better than the other groups.

  Should we tell them how great they are, or tell them they are wrong?

  GREAT:
  Like so many of us, this group responds really well to positive reinforcement. And, they really have done exceptional work crafting a means of stopping the spread of (disaster). Making the temperamental members of this group feel good about themselves let them feel more comfortable admitting they need xx from the others.

  Success!

  WRONG:
  Whoa. Well, that made them mad. Now, they are demanding that we leave. Should we go, or apologize?

  GO:  Fortunately, the group members took our retreat as a show of respect and have agreed to cooperate and share what their knowledge with the others.

    FOOD: Based on (decision), next we go to the group that has mastered the food system.

  APOLOGIZE: Fortunately, the group members accept our apology. It takes a big person to admit that they are wrong! They now respect us and have agreed to cooperate.

    FOOD: Based on (decision), next we go to the group that has mastered the food system.


  2SHELTER: We have arrived at a patchwork of makeshift homes. (description of some -- vague reference to one that looks like a TARDIS) All provide basic protection from the elements and at least some barrier to fend off attacking creatues. However, a lack of long-term planning is evident. The dwellings built first are far superior and some have redundant features using materials that would have been better saved for homes built later on.

  We know that this is inclined to cooperate with others, and are further motivated by the knowledge that their food supply will run out soon. So, we have a pretty easy decision to make.  Should we invite them to cooperate in the great building of humanity, or should we throw rocks at them?

  INVITE TO COOPERATE: Great choice! Not surprisingly, this hungry, collaborative group is more than happy to join our efforts to rebuild humanity.

  THROW ROCKS: Seriously?
    INVITE TO COOPERATE: Great choice! Not surprisingly, this hungry, collaborative group is more than happy to join our efforts to rebuild humanity.

    [On our way to our next destination a child from the group
    (something happens -- should we help?)
    Well, you know what I always say. "Be helpful."
    "Oh really," you respond. "That's what you always say?"
    "Yep. Always."]

---------------

Our walk to our final destination is a long one. They are all the way down by the river.
convo
"Isn't this the group described as being lazy?" you ask. "Strange that the lazy people would travel this far away just to sit around and do nothing."


Thanks to the communciation and relationship-buidling, everyone cooperates, thrives and humanity is saved!
